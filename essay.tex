\section{Introduction}

The size and the nature of the connections that are formed between countries is often the 
basis for their trade, levels of peace, and their national and cultural identity, (Hollis, M., 1990). 
The ways in which states are connected, through trade and politics at the macro level is 
well understood and widely written about, but these studies have relied 
on data which is purely macro, such as customs data, foreign investments, and trade 
data, (Gandolfo, G. 1998), newer studies have been able to take into account online data 
as a novel data source, but this has been limited in scope, and did not extend to the
true potential of this sort of data, (State, B. 2015)(Garcia-Gavilanes, 2014).
The potential of this method of data was better demonstrated by "Who Ties the World Together?", (Chi, G. 2020).
The researchers in this paper were given access to the Meta dataset, and were therefore able to 
analyse relationships in unprecedented detail and frankness. Their paper demonstrates the degree
to which researchers have not been able to utilise micro connections in their studies - as they 
put it "\textit{who} connects the world", (p 1, Introduction). 

Understanding International Relations in this way facilitates new methods of evaluating the 
theories that constitute it. For instance, Hafner-Burton et al. (2009) aims to better 
understand networks as the relations between individual agents, what "define[s], enable[s] and 
constrain[s]" them, but feels limited by "trivial conclusions" and "unproven assertions". 
The research demonstrated by Chi, G et al (2020) makes the available assertions more accurate
and the conclusions more interesting. Coleman (1994) discusses the disconnect in the study  
of macro versus micro, as data for each is unable to cleanly overlap.

The results of Chi, et al (2020) render previous research more open to criticism for the 
uncoupling of micro and macro, and the lack of accounting for the role of individual in 
the international relationships between countries. They demonstrate that migrants are a 
binding position in social networks, bridging the gaps between communities, and that by 
reshaping society at the domestic level, they have a substantial effect at the international 
level. This is clear when you consider the branching effect of a migrant social tie: 
when an individual moves 
to a new country, the ties that they make in the host country connect back to their relationships 
in their home country. These results are consistent with other research 
that uses more primitive methods, such as Perkins et al (2013), but (as will be the main 
conclusion of this project): although the final 
results/conclusions are often similar when researchers use primitive or novel datasets, 
the granularity of the results when using the novel datasets featured in papers such as Chi et al (2020) 
and therefore the weight that can be 
attributed to their is vital to take into account 
when considering the viability of older methods in the face of the accuracy and depth of 
the social media companies' datasets.
An example of their accuracy is the ability to graphically model the effects that individual
 migrants have on a network. Such granularity cannot be achieved without social media datasets.

Considering this, it would be a useful contribution to the literature to 
analyse how this novel style of research compares to more primitive methods, (particularly 
for the study of migrants' networking effects): Meta has so far 
only released two papers using their dataset for this specific area of study
(the study of migrants and their roles in social networks) - there are only two featured on their 
research page. As such, it is evidently a nascent area of study. 

This project will primarily compare the Chi et al. (2020) paper to 
existing literature, as of the two papers available, it is best suited to international 
analysis and global migrant networks. 

\section{Existing Literature}

\textit{
	This section will look at existing literature exemplifying some of the existing 
	research methodologies and datasets which are either most prevalent in the study 
	of migrant networks and cross-country ties, or share commonalities with Chi et al (2020), 
	such as the usage of communication systems or social networking apps.
}
\newline

As stated in the introduction, existing studies have demonstrated somewhat of a disconnect 
between macro and micro, as methodologies would lose individuals in order to 
study flows of people or to gain a broad understanding of a wide network, 
such as cross-country interaction. One such example 
is Amin, et al. (1994), which demonstrates that in the advent of globalisation, certain 
"global cities", (Short, et al. 1996), can be well analysed as part of an international 
network, in how they facilitate trade through presenting global business hubs; this flow 
of money attracts travel, creating diverse communities. One can then assert that this creates 
further business through entrepreneurs filling gaps in markets with inspiration from their 
home country, for instance foreign restaurants, (these networks comprised of individuals are shown by Chi et al, (2020) to 
be vital to international networks). 

However, other 
papers have criticised some of the assertions made by researchers focusing on this subject, 
such as Derudder, (2006). Derudder criticises the lack of empirical evidence brought by 
these studies, expressing that assertions are made and regurgitated without proper 
verification. Short et al, (1996), although 
welcome to the notion of urban networks and their global impact, has the primary goal 
of discussing and demonstrating this 'dirty little secret'. Its main criticism is that 
there needs to be a greater availability of comparative statistics, as the researchers 
also consider other studies to be repeating common assertions without using data which is open 
and accessible. In the wake of this, newer studies sought to tackle this dearth of data, 
such as Mahutga, et al.(2010). While these efforts have served to create 
greater data availability in order to study urban networks, and their their roles and 
ranking as global hubs, these studies still suffer 
from the previously mentioned issues where individuals are sacrificed for macro level analysis. 
Taking Mahutga (2010), the researchers use airline data as their empirical evidence 
for grading urban hubs and their internationality. But as discussed, this method 
is unable to analyse relationships at the individual level: plotting this 
research, nodes would constitute thousands of individuals. This is very limiting of 
any network-oriented study of migration with an interest in micro analysis.

Malecki (2002) and Townsend (2001) both used internet connections between urban hubs 
in order to analyse their position within a global network, measuring speed and traffic
in order to make assertions about them. This suffers the same detachment from micro 
studies as airline data, while also being potentially misleading, as 
less important cities in the network may act as "gateways" (Chi et al, 2020) to
larger hubs, so the data would overstate their position, (Rutherford, J. et al, 2004).

Other attempts have been made with more modern datasets to maintain more granular 
information. Takhteyev (2012) used Twitter data to analyse social ties. However, this 
research was done in 2012, when social media (especially Twitter) was practically 
nascent, only being regularly used by a very small proportion of the population,
relative to the usership of today. Furthermore, its analysis sought to predict Twitter ties, 
for instance using regularity of flights between areas and then comparing this to the 
numbers of Twitter ties between these same areas. This seems much more a study 
of Twitter itself, than an analysis of migrant networks using the incredible data that 
social media makes available. Other studies were similarly conducted, marvelling more 
at the novelty of social media, and using other metrics to study its linking effect, 
rather than primarily using the links on display to make assertions and conclusions. 
Such examples are Backstrom (2012), which uses Facebook data rather than Twitter data: 
the paper notes the order of magnitude greater sample that they have available compared 
to Milgram (1967), a study with a similar research topic, analysing networks of individuals 
and how they are distanced from one another. Reading Chi et al (2020), the same comparison 
of orders of magnitude larger sample size and granularity is blatant, as the popularity 
of social media and its penetration into society has exploded. Furthermore, a particularly  
important aspect to consider is the popularity of social media abroad: at the time of Backstrom et al's 
research, Facebook revenue outside of the United States and Canada was just under three
dollars a year per user, now it is over 25 (Dixon, S. 2023). This demonstrates the
 ineffectiveness of social media for measuring migrant networks at the time of 
their research versus today, as the reach of social media outside of the western world was so much smaller.

Some earlier studies of human mobility and migrants' position in networks used mobile phone data to 
track movement, (Gonzalez, et al. 2008), or communication by analysing phone traffic (Perkins et al, 2013).
This is proves more effective than using other forms of proxy data mentioned earlier,  
however it is still less accurate, and uses a smaller cohort than is possible with social media 
data, (Gonzalez had access to 100,000 callers, which pales at the billions of users available to Chi et al (2020)). 
Kikas et al, (2015), served as a proof of concept of the effectiveness of using social 
media data to analyse and predict migration patterns, noting the usefulness for tracking 
demographic changes. The reasearchers were able to use login data from 15 million 
Skype users, demonstrating the enormous size of the datasets available when using social 
networking data. However, this method used the IP addresses from which users were logging 
on in order to understand their migration. This method is only accurate at the country 
level (Kikas, section 2.1)
and therefore can only used to see the migration of individuals between countries,
sort of as an upgraded usage of the flight data mentioned earlier. No modelling or 
analysis can be done of where migrants go once they are in a country, or who they interact 
with, neutering any ability to assess global hubs or migrants' impact on the social 
networks in the host country, or how their integration into a host country impacts their 
home country.

Herdagdelen et al (2016) is perhaps the most interesting research and is the most 
pertinent to this project, as it is sort of a precursor to the Chi et al paper. The researchers 
note that their study is "the first large-scale analysis of immigrants’ social networks in the 
United States" (page 83, Conclusion),
and offers similar insight into the relationships that migrants form in host countries, such 
as a predisposition to form ties with compatriots. They do note some inaccuracies however, 
such as their usage of users' home countries as they are reported on their home page. This 
removes any user that does not report their home page from the data set. It also biases 
the dataset towards those who are perhaps proud of their origins, as they are more likely 
to display their country of origin, (there may, of course be other reasons for not reporting 
origin, this is just one speculation by the researchers). They note that issues like this, 
as well, as the potential for online ties to not wholly reflect offline ties, mean that 
their methods require greater testing. The method obviously should be lauded though: as 
the researchers state, one of their motivations was the inability to gain micro level insight
from existing research methods, such as surveys, therefore warranting the use of more 
personal data. 


Finally, Zagheni et al (2017) uses the Facebook advertising API to measure migrant numbers 
in America. Their study is primarily to measure stocks and demographics of migrants, 
rather than specifically network bases motivation, however their methodology is similar to 
that of Chi (2020) and Herdagdelen (2016), in that it is able to survey a very large portion of 
the population through social media companies' datasets. They also note biases in their data 
however, as they find that their statics slightly overestimate numbers of younger 
migrants, and underestimate the numbers of older migrants. This is evidently because a 
greater proportion of social media users are young. Furthermore, their use of the advertiser 
API, although novel, is limited to simply numbers, and again cannot go beyond measuring stocks. 
Furthermore, it may be unclear if the API is completely candid in its measures of stocks, 
as it may be the case that Facebook is more likely to push advertisers to a 
specific demographic (perhaps there is a subset of the user base that is particularly susceptible 
to advertisements), therefore reducing the 
exposure of some user demographics to the sample.

Reviewing the existing literature, I have included research which either demonstrates more 
primitive methods of data collection pertinent to this subject, or research which 
utilises social media or other online-oriented datasets but does not make use of the 
same level of potential as does "Who Ties The World Together?", (Chi et al, 2020). These 
inclusions are relevant for this project as it is important to gain a perspective on 
what research methodology used to look like, how it has progressed, and where it is currently,
in order to answer my research question.

\section{Methodology}

The analysis section will focus in on particular papers mentioned in the previous section. 
analysing their research and their conclusions, in order to compare them to the 
detail and the accuracy of the Chi et al (2020) research paper. In this way, I will be 
able to deduce what the exact limitations are of previous research methods and how they 
effect the outcomes of the studies. 

I will not only be able to see what detracts from previous studies, but also understand 
where social media datasets and Chi et al's research falls short: for instance, what 
the biases inherent in the data? What are the effects? How can this limit the dataset's usage?
I will also discuss whether previous studies could have been improved with this novel 
data, or whether the questions of the research were themselves limited by the expectations
of the researchers, and what they knew was possible with the data that was available. Could 
these questions have been revised faced with the size and the detail of the Meta (Facebook) dataset?

\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{The Cons Of Social Media Datasets}

I will begin by evaluating the limitations of the methodology used in Chi et al (2020). The 
primary limitation of the dataset is that it is not wholly representative of the entire 
population, rather it represents a biased subset of the population: Mellon et al, (2017)
analysed Twitter and Facebook users in the United Kingdom and compared various demographics 
and their political views. The results of the paper were that the user base of social 
media platforms is generally younger, better educated, and more politically active 
than the population average. This is of course to be expected, and seems a sensible conclusion, 
but it is something of an indictment against the usefulness of the data for specific studies, (
	this fact will be useful later
), and these results are reinforced by other studies, such as Greenwood et al (2016), and 
Duggan (2015). Furthermore, social media users are more likely to be motivated by and interested 
in politics (after controlling for demographics in the case of Facebook, (Mellon et al, 2017)),
while also being less likely to vote, but when they do vote, they will most likely vote to the 
left, and for a more liberal agenda. These facts are of course important to keep in mind 
when doing any sort of social science study, but they are more pertinent for specific kinds 
of studies: a paper which is specifically trying to gauge the political motivations of an 
entire country cannot utilise the social media dataset without being careful to control 
for bias, and taking other steps to ensure that the study is accurate. But there are myriad
other research which would not need to be so careful. In Chi et al (2020), the motivation 
is to study social networks of individuals, and what effects migrants have when they integrate 
into a host country. Such a study finds much greater benefit in being able to use an 
incredibly large sample size, which covers a global scope, with detailed analytics on 
individual relationships and social ties, than these drawbacks are to its detriment. 

Perkins et al (2013) does not seem to suffer the same bias drawbacks that Chi et al (2020) does, 
and yet they found similar results (that migrants are a vital part of communication 
networks). Either, Perkins suffers the same biases and therefore the same groups are not 
being represented by the sample, or Perkins is void of the bias issues, is representative, 
and yet still comes to the same conclusions. Both these outcomes indicates that the social 
media dataset is useful in analysing global social networks at a micro and macro level: 
each study represents one of the primary methods of available communication, therefore 
any migrant not using them will not be contributing to the bridging effect present in 
both studies, and therefore is unimportant to analysing global social networks, as they are 
not a part of any substantial network. Of course it would be an interesting study in 
itself to analyse those migrants who exist in social groups not captured by the primary 
methods of communication, but they are not necessarily an important section to miss in the 
type of study being presently discussed. If migrants were found to not have a bridging 
effect, as they were not utilising communication networks, the social media dataset would 
be unhelpful, as migrants are not being represented, but as it stands, an important 
proportion of them are, and they are useful to a study of global social networks. This 
argument would demonstrate that while usage of this novel dataset does need to be 
tempered and controlled, for specific studies, the benefits greatly outweigh detriment. 

The second criticism is the availability of social media datasets. Boyd et al (2012) 
raises the point that sociologists and other political scientists will have access 
to data which is not available to the wider research community, this produces "unevenness 
in the system". Other researchers are not only unable to do similar research of their own, 
but they are unable to reproduce the research of those within the company, and therefore 
cannot properly test their methodology. This is an unfortunate truth of the matter, and 
there seems to be little that can be done about it: the effectiveness of these datasets 
should encourage their usage, but without free and open access, their usage is tarnished.

\subsection{The Benefits of the Dataset}

The great advantages of the Facebook dataset used by Chi et al (2020) are its size, 
its detail, and its frankness. 

First its size. The dataset is enormous compared to other, even similar style datasets: 
for instance, take the Skype dataset used in Kikas et al (2015). Altough the researchers 
were using data from a socially oriented online network, they only had access to 100,000 
users, which pales in comparison the billions available to Chi et al. There are 
certainly, statistically, diminishing returns in accuracy as a dataset grows, but billions 
compared to even millions is a substantial upgrade in accuracy and breadth of scope. 
Especially as the data used by Kikas is login data from between 2007 and 2011. At the time, 
wifi speeds, camera quality, and microphone quality necessary for video call (the primary 
usage of Skype, particularly at the time, although the app does offer messaging) would
suggest that the individuals surveyed would have a greater bias towards more well off 
migrants. Of course a similar bias would exist to an extent in the Facebook dataset, 
however to a much smaller degree, as all that is necessary is a smartphone, the price of 
which has fallen substantially (a large reason for Facebook and other social networking 
sites and apps can have such a large user base, even in countries with lower average incomes.)
The size of such a dataset better enables the modelling seen in Chi et al, (2020). With such 
a dataset, Kikas could have more accurately plotted the connections between countries (the 
primary focus of the paper) as they would have had a much larger sample of the global 
population to work with. As the researchers were studying cross-country migration, 
100,000 points actually seems relatively small: the number of migrants worldwide in June 2019
was estimated at almost 272 million, (Bauloz et al , World Migration Report 2020). As such, 
to only be able to look at the logins of less than 0.04\% of these is underwhelming, 
and certainly does little to properly comprehend cross country ties. The Facebook dataset 
however, accounts for close to half of the world's population, and shows a smaller degree 
of bias (although there is still important bias that should be accounted for). Using this 
dataset, Chi et al (2020) were able to measure the proportion of international ties that 
involve migrants (17.09\%, Results subsection 4.1). With only a measure of 100,000 
individuals (and data of login locations by country, with basically no data on country 
of origin), Kikas et al are completely unable to come to any similar conclusion (at least 
while ensuring accuracy). They could even measure the proportion of these international 
relationships which are constituted by migrant to local ties, and migrant to country of origin 
ties, (39.4\% and 27.88\% respectively). One would assume that in trying to measure cross-country 
connections, Kikas et al would have naturally made these same measurements, were the data 
available. This is testament to the effectiveness of the Facebook dataset, but also calls back 
to the limitations that it imposes on researchers outside of the company. 

The second primary benefit of social media datasets are their detail and accuracy. Chi et al (2020) 
reproduce the results of Bhagat et al (2016) and Backstrom et al (2012) in computing 
the shortest path between users, using friendship status as the connecting factor. However, 
they were able to also analyse the specific bridging effect of migrants, measuring their 
"betweenness". This was done through measuring the shrinkage of global Facebook graph, 
with and without migrants (nodes in the graph containing only locals had a larger shortest 
path than the graph with migrants included). In this way, they were able to clearly 
demonstrate the effect that migrants have in effectively shrinking the world. This 
is equivalent to the results of Perkins et al (2013), which also documented the 
bridging effect of migrants, however that study was only able to measure across country 
phone traffic, and demonstrate the levels of communication constituted by migrant conversation.
The researchers were not able to specifically plot the connections between individuals, and 
measure the paths between them, and observe how migrants influenced these paths. Bhagat et al (2016) 
and Backstrom et al (2012) were able to make similarly detailed analyses of social connections 
in their shortest path computations, as they also had access to the Facebook dataset, 
also demonstrating its usefulness. However, they did not exploit its potential to the 
degree shown in Chi et al (2020), which again specifically demonstrated how a specific 
demographic fit into a social network and what effects are caused by their presence. Disregarding 
the particular interest in migrants, equivalent research could be done using the dataset 
for any other section of the population (provided they are well enough represented, calling 
back to the previous criticism of under representation of some groups. For instance it would 
likely be difficult to make assertions about the effect of any elderly demographic on a social network). 

The final point to focus in on are the especially micro analyses of Chi et al (2020), using 
"ego networks" to observe the social networks which exist around given individuals. These tests 
also involved including and removing migrants in order to more clearly demonstrate their 
impact on the network. The graphs below are from Chi et al section 4.3, "Ego-networks".

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{graphs_2.png}

In the above figure, violet nodes and edges show connections in the current country and 
orange are connections in the home country. However this is not the point to focus on: 
the important aspect is the granularity of the data and its scope. Chi et al (2020) mentions 
that in order to achieve micro level data, the previous best solution was surveys and interviews, 
however this has a very limited scope, as the numbers of people available to ask is small 
compared to any substantial dataset, and it is not feasible for individuals to effectively 
report the numbers of relationships that they have in their home country and their host country, 
and then report the degrees of separation between these connections and the broader network. This 
dataset is able to do exactly that: plot individual relationships and the branching outcomes of  
these ties as they spread through the network, while also accounting for the effects of 
specific demographics. There is no other type of data that can achieve this insight, it is 
unparalleled in the measuring of networks, and individual ties between countries. 

\section{Conclusion}

Social media datasets offer a novel method for social science research. Researchers have 
previously criticised the detachment between micro and macro level analyses in 
the research of migration patterns and global networks. However, more primitive methods 
of research and the nature of available data made fixing this frustration near impossible:
existing datasets, such as air traffic data or phone traffic could give macro level insight
but could not offer the granularity required for micro analysis. Research methods which 
aimed to study at the micro level had to use interviews or surveys to understand 
anything relative to the individual, but it was not feasible to extend this research 
to a large enough sample to include macro features. With the advent of social media, and 
social media companies' growing wealth of users' data, large samples of data can be used 
which also offer great detail and frankness at the level of the individual. Such datasets 
have been increasingly used and their potential increasingly exploited, from using basic 
methodologies, such as registering login locations cross-country with IP tagging, (Kikas, 2015), 
to the advanced, incredibly granular, incredibly detailed study of social networks at a 
macro and micro level, while isolating specific demographics in order to better understand their 
impact on the network, (Chi et al, 2020). The usefulness of these datasets has certainly been 
proven. 

However, as with any method or data, social media datasets have drawbacks: although they offer 
enormous samples, they are not wholly representative of the entire population, they 
offer a slice which is on average better educated, more political, and younger, (Boyd, 2012). 
They are also limited in their access, as only those researchers who work within the company 
can make use of the data. This is detrimental to the field, as others are not able 
to properly reproduce, and therefore validate the studies. Also, research questions 
may have to be limited despite the potential for their study, because the data is limited, 
which holds back progress. 

Overall, social media datasets are clearly more a pro than con, as one would not likely 
argue that they should not ever be used: their usefulness has been completed validated by 
the novel studies that have been discussed in this project. While not as usable for some 
studies, such as the study of the impact of the very old on demographics, due to their 
under-representation, their usefulness for the study of issues which require micro and macro 
level analysis simultaneously (as long the particular demographic is properly represented, as mentioned)
, such as the study of migrants is indispensable. Chi et al's (2020) plotting of 
individual migrant relationships and ties in both their host country and home country, 
and their release of empirical evidence to back up assertions which have been criticised for their previously 
not having been proven, (Short, 1996), should be clear progress of the methodology for 
using this kind of data. One can only hope that social media datasets will 
become accessible to the wider 
research community, as this would be invaluable in the study of migrant networks.
