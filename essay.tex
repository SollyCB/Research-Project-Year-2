\section{Introduction}

The size and the nature of the connections that are formed between countries is often the 
basis for their trade, levels of peace, and their national and cultural identity, (Hollis, M., 1990). 
The ways in which states are connected, through trade and politics at the macro level is 
well understood and widely written about, but these studies have relied 
on data which is purely macro, such as customs data, foreign investments, and trade 
data, (Gandolfo, G. 1998), newer studies have been able to take into account online data 
as a novel data source, but this has been limited in scope, and did not extend to the
true potential of this sort of data, (State, B. 2015)(Garcia-Gavilanes).
The potential of this method of data was better demonstrated by "Who Ties the World Together?", (Chi, G. 2020).
The researchers in this paper were given access to the Meta dataset, and were therefore able to 
analyse relationships in unprecedented detail and frankness. Their paper demonstrates the degree
to which researchers have not been able to utilise micro connections in their studies - as they 
put it "\textit{who} connects the world", (p 1, Introduction). 

Understanding International Relations in this way facilitates new methods of evaluating the 
theories that constitute it. For instance, Hafner-Burton et al. (2009) aims to better 
understand networks as the relations between individual agents, what "define[s], enable[s] and 
constrain[s]" them, but feels limited by "trivial conclusions" and "unproven assertions". 
The research demonstrated by Chi, G et al (2020) makes the available assertions more accurate
and the conclusions more interesting. Coleman (1994) discusses the disconnect in the study  
of macro versus micro, as data for each is unable to cleanly overlap.

The results of Chi, et al (2020) render previous research more open to criticism for the 
uncoupling of micro and macro, and the lack of accounting for the role of individual in 
the international relationships between countries. They demonstrate that migrants are a 
binding position in social networks, bridging the gaps between communities, and that by 
reshaping society at the domestic level, they have a substantial effect at the international 
level. This is clear when you consider the branching effect: when an individual moves 
to a new country, the ties that they make in the host country and connected back to the ties 
that they have in their home country. Their results are consistent with other research 
that uses more primitive methods, such as Perkins et al (2013), but as will be the main conclusion of this project: although the final 
results/conclusions are often similar when researchers use primitive versus novel datasets, 
the accuracy of the results and therefore the weight that can be 
given to the conclusions when modern datasets are utilised is vital to take into account 
when considering the viability of older methods in the face of the accuracy and depth of 
the social media companies' datasets.
An example of their accuracy is the ability to graphically model the effects that migrants 
play in a community, using Facebook "friending" as edge between individuals as nodes. As such,
the researchers are able to simulate the growth patterns of the same communities, but with the 
migrants removed: this is possible as the Facebook dataset has existed for years, and so 
the same trends that took place can be reproduced, while editing certain variables. Using a 
less accurate method of study, such a simulation would exacerbate the inherent inaccuracies, 
due to simple statistics.

Considering the points discussed so far, it would be a useful contribution to the literature to 
analyse how this novel style of research compares to more primitive methods: Meta has so far 
only released two papers using their dataset for this specific study (the study of migration 
and the relationships between migrants) from what I can find, as such, it is evidently a 
nascent area of study. This project will primarily compare the Chi et al. (2020) paper to 
existing literature, as of the two papers available, it is best suited to international 
analysis. As the research available using this dataset is currently so limited, I have no option 
but to focus on a single paper. However, this is not restrictive of the project: the paper is 
a clear demonstration of the effectiveness, the scope, the detail, and the frankness of this 
nascent methodology (using social media datasets), hence this projected should not be disregarded 
for its lack of breadth. This is a deeply interesting area to analyse.

\section{Existing Literature}

\textit{
	This section will look at existing literature exemplifying some of the existing 
	methodologies which are either most prevalent, or show commonalities with the methodology 
	of Chi et al. (2020), such as literature studying networks. Unfortunately, as this paper is so recent, I was unable to find 
	literature pertaining exactly to this question (a critique of primitive methods in the 
	face of "Who Ties The World Together?", (2020)). I consider this a positive aspect, as 
	it demonstrates the contritbutions of this project. However, it does mean that this 
	section will be briefly reviewing and laying out the literature that will be more closely
	considered in the analysis section.

As stated in the introduction, existing studies have demonstrated somewhat of a disconnect 
between macro and micro, as their methodologies would lose the individuals in order to 
study flows of people or to gain a broad understanding of wide network. One such example 
is Amin, et al. (1994), which demonstrates that in the advent of globalisation, certain 
"global cities", (Short, et al. 1996), can be well analysed as part of an international 
network, in how they: facilitate trade through offering global business hubs; this flow 
of money attracts travel, creating diverse communities, and one can then assert that creates 
further business through entrepreneurs filling gaps in markets with inspiration from their 
home country, for instance foreign restaurants, (these networks comprised of individuals are shown by Chi et al, (2020) to 
be vital to international networks). 

However, other 
papers have criticised some of the assertions made by researchers focusing on this subject, 
such as Derudder, (2006). Derudder criticises the lack of empirical evidence brought by 
in these analyses: despite their sensible nature, a dearth of empirical evidence is 
a frustration to the argument, (this was of course a valid criticism before the Chi et al 
paper, which \textit{was} able to give empirical evidence). Short et al, (1996), although 
welcome to the notion of urban networks and their global impact, has the primary goal 
of discussing and demonstrating this 'dirty little secret'. Its main criticism is that 
there needs to be a greater availability of comparative statistics, as the researchers 
consider other studies to be repeating common assertions without using data which open 
and accessible. In the wake of this, newer studies sought tackle this dearth of data 
specifically, such as Mahutga, et al.(2010). While these efforts have served to create 
greater data availability in order to study urban networks, these studies still suffer 
from the previously mentioned issues where individuals are lost at the macro level. 
Taking Mahutga (2010), the researchers use airline data as their empirical evidence 
for grading urban hubs and their internationality. But as discussed, this method 
is unable to analyse relationships at the individual level: expressing this graphically,
 one can only place nodes 
modeling an inherently macro network, comprised of edges indicating flows of thousands 
of people, all deeply detached from any micro analysis. This is very limiting of 
any network-oriented.

Malecki (2002) and Townsend (2001) both used internet connections between urban hubs 
in order to analyse their position within a global network, measuring speed and traffic
in order to make assertions about them. This suffers the same detachment from micro 
studies that airline data suffers while also being potentially misleading, as 
less important cities in the network may act as "gateways" (Chi et al, 2020) to
larger hubs, so the data would over state their position, (Rutherford, J. et al, 2004).

Other attempts have been made with more modern datasets to maintain more granular 
information. Takhteyev (2012) used Twitter data to analyse social ties. However, this 
research was done in 2012, when social media (especially Twitter) was practically 
nascent, only being regularly used by a very small proportion of the population 
relative to today. Furthermore, it analysed what were the predictors of Twitter ties, 
for instance regularity of flights between areas and then comparing this to the 
numbers of Twitter ties between these same areas. This seems much more a study 
of Twitter itself, than an analysis of migrant networks using the incredible data that 
social media makes available - case in point, at this time, this data hardly existed, 
relative to its size today. Other studies were similarly conducted, marvelling more 
at the novelty of social media, and using other metrics to study its linking effect, 
rather than primarily using the links on display to make assertions and conclusions. 
Such examples are Backstrom (2012), which uses Facebook data rather than Twitter data: 
the paper notes the order of magnitude greater sample that they have available compared 
to Milgram (1967), a study with a similar research topic, analysing networks of individuals 
and how they are distanced from one another. Reading Chi et al (2020), the same comparison 
of orders of magnitude larger sample size and granularity is blatant, as the popularity 
of social media and its penetration into society has exploded. Furthermore, a particularly  
important aspect to consider is the popularity of social media abroad: at the time of this 
research Facebook revenue outside of the United States and Canada was just under three
million dollars, now it is over 25 million (Dixon, S. 2023). This demonstrates the ineffectiveness of social 
media for measuring migrant networks at the time of this research versus today.

Some earlier studies of human mobility and migrants' position in networks used mobile phone data to 
track movement, (Gonzalez, et al. 2008), or communication by analysing phone traffic (Perkins et al, 2013).
This is proves more effective than using other forms of proxy data mentioned earlier,  
however it is still less accurate, and uses a smaller cohort than is possible with social media 
data, (Gonzalez used 100,000 callers, which pales at the millions used by Chi (2020)). 
Kikas et al, (2015), served as a proof of concept of the effectiveness of using social 
media data to analyse and predict migration patterns, noting the usefulness for tracking 
demographic changes. The reasearchers were able to use login data from 15 million 
Skype users, demonstrating the enormous size of the datasets available when using social 
networking data. However, this method used the IP addresses from which users were logging 
on in order to understand migration. This method is only accurate at the country level (Kikas, section 2.1)
and therefore can only used to see the migration of individuals between countries,
sort of as an upgraded usage of the flight data mentioned earlier. No modelling or 
analysis can be done of where migrants go once they are in a country, or who they interact 
with, neutering any ability to assess global hubs or migrants impact on the social 
networks in the host country, or how their integration into a host country impacts their 
home country.

Herdagdelen et al (2016) is perhaps the most interesting research and is the most 
pertinent to this project, as it is sort of a precursor to the Chi et al paper. The researchers 
note that their study is "the first large-scale analysis of immigrants’ social networks in the United States" (page 83, Conclusion),
and offers similar insight into the relationships that migrants form in host countries, such 
as a predisposition to form ties with compatriots. They do note some inaccuracies however, 
such as their usage of users' home countries as they are reported on their home page. This 
removes any user that does not report their home page from the data set. It also biases 
the dataset towards those who are perhaps proud of their origins, as they are more likely 
to display their country of origin, (there may, of course be other reasons for not reporting 
origin, this is just on speculation by the researchers). They note that issues like this, 
as well as the potential for online ties to not wholly reflect offline ties, mean that 
their methods require greater testing. The method obviously should be lauded though: as 
the researchers state, one of their motivations was the inability to gain micro level insight
from existing research methods, such as surveys, therefore warranting the use of more 
personal data. 

Finally, Zagheni et al, (2017)....

\section{Methodology}
Compare the findings of Chi to those of other papers which were interested in analysing 
migrant data and networks.

\section{Results}
Skype used IP geolocation: only accurate at country level, can only track login 
locations, does not model relationships, etc.
